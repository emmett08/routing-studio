# Routing Studio (React 19 + TypeScript 5+)

A local-first UI for creating and editing a `*.routing.json` file.

## Run

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Key UX features

- Drag & drop **Open** of an existing routing file to prepopulate.
- **Undo / Redo**.
- Integrity validation (unknown models, missing classes, etc).
- Class builder with **search + add**, reorder, and rule-based suggestions.
- Extensible *UI metadata* stored separately (localStorage) to avoid breaking strict consumers.
